# mac-quick-actions

Small macOS integrations generated from plain text and worth versioning:
two Finder Quick Actions for comparing files in VS Code, and a tiny
application that holds the Accessibility permission for a Control Center
hotkey.

```bash
./install.sh              # install the Quick Actions; build the app if absent
./install.sh --rebuild    # rebuild the app (costs the Accessibility grant — see below)
./build.sh                # regenerate the .workflow bundles from the templates
```

## Compare two files from different folders

A Finder selection is per window, so one action cannot take two files from
two folders. Two actions with a note in between do it:

1. Folder A → right-click file 1 → **Quick Actions → Compare: Select First**
2. Folder B → right-click file 2 → **Quick Actions → Compare: With This**

VS Code opens the diff. (Two files in the same folder need no detour:
select both and use VS Code's own *Compare* action, if you have it.)

The menu shows `Compare: Select First`; the bundle on disk is
`Compare - Select First.workflow` — a colon is not legal in a file name.
Search System Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts → Services for the colon form,
which is also where a service that arrived disabled is switched on and gets
a shortcut. If an action does nothing, open its bundle in Automator and
press Run: the log shows the real error.

## Control Center Toggle.app

macOS grants Accessibility to a *running application*, never to a script,
so a hotkey that drives the menu bar needs an app for the grant to attach
to. `install.sh` compiles `control-center-toggle.applescript` into
`/Applications/Control Center Toggle.app`. Two steps stay manual:

1. Launch the app once and grant it under **Privacy & Security →
   Accessibility** — do not test it from Automator, that grants Automator.
2. **Shortcuts** → new shortcut → **Open App** → *Control Center Toggle* →
   ⓘ → **Run with** → your key combination.

The grant is bound to the app's path *and* contents: moving the app or
running `--rebuild` silently invalidates it while the toggle still looks
on. Remove the entry with **−**, launch, re-grant. If access is still denied
with the toggle on: `tccutil reset Accessibility <bundle-id>`, then re-grant.
A hotkey that only beeps never reached the app — pick another combination.
